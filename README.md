# DCA-ETF-Autotrader
A Python-based portfolio optimizer combining Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) and Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to maximize Sharpe Ratio over time.

This project implements an automated investment strategy that:
* Uses Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO) to allocate investments efficiently.
* Follows a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) approach, investing a fixed amount regularly.
* Maximizes Sharpe Ratio to optimize the risk-return tradeoff.
* Compares an optimized multi-ETF portfolio with a single-asset S&P 500 investment.

It was developed as a practical application of portfolio theory, combining quantitative finance with Python programming.
